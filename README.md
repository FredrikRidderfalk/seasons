## My process

- I maintained high contrast ratios (13.1:1, 7.74:1) throughout the website, passing all WCAG tests. Tested using [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=000000&bcolor=16DFBD).

### Built with

- React

### What I learned

- How to use Create React App.
- How to build content using JSX.
- App lifecycle methods.
- State in React components.
- How to structure apps with function-based components.
- How to structure apps with class-based components.
- How to communicate using props.

### Continued development

The user should be able to see more information based on their geolocation, like local time, weather, temperature.

### Useful resources

- [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) - My source for all of my UI components.
- [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/) - Enabled me to build an interactive interface.
